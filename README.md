# VariableDefinitionsAndTypes

This project provides a simple guide to variable definitions and types in C#. It covers basic data types such as integers, doubles, strings, booleans, chars, and `var` type variables. You will also learn how to define constants and concatenate different types of variables.

## Project Structure

The `Program.cs` file includes the `Main` method where all variable definitions and examples are demonstrated. Each variable is printed to the console to show how to use and display different data types.

## Code Examples

The following variables are defined in this project:

- **Integer**: `int age = 25;`
- **Double**: `double height = 1.75;`
- **String**: `string name = "John Doe";`
- **Boolean**: `bool isStudent = true;`
- **Char**: `char grade = 'A';`
- **Var**: `var country = "USA";`
- **Constant**: `const double PI = 3.14159;`

### Example Output


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Run the `Program.cs` file to see the variable definitions and types in action.

## Purpose

This project is a basic introduction to variable usage in C# and is suitable for beginners learning to understand variable types, their declaration, and how to output their values.
